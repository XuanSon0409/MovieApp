# Challenge – Create a Sign‑In & Sign‑Up System  
*(Movie Search Application)*

The goal is to build a movie‑search application that uses external APIs and modern JavaScript features.  
Users can look up films and view detailed information about them.  
You may leverage the **OMDb API**, which returns data such as title, year, plot and ratings.

---

## 📄 Application Pages&nbsp;*(build order)*

1. **Home**  
2. **Movie Details**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**  
- **SCSS** – variables, mixins, nesting, `@extend`  
- **BEM**‑structured class naming  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – API integration & user interactions  
- **Fetch API** – HTTP requests

---

## ✅ Challenge Requirements

- Build a movie‑search app that matches the given design.  
- Provide a search input so users can enter a movie name.  
- Show the list of results **or** a **“Movie not found”** message when nothing matches.  
- Ensure full responsiveness across different screen sizes.
